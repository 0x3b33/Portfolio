### Lack of seuqnecer check

## Summary
As discussed with the team behind this project (Patric), this stable coin can be deployed on any EVM chain, and if deployed on L2 ChainLink will not work, as there is no check for a sequencer.

## Vulnerability Details
When utilizing Chainlink on L2 chains like ARB or OP, it's important to ensure that the provided prices are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. Even ChainLink [recommends](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds) to check for a sequencer. Without this check price feeds could be wrong.

Example:
- USDC de-pegs after the last update, but sequencer is down, so when ChainLink triggers a forced [heartbeat](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd) (due to the price moving more than 0.25%, in the span of 1 heartbeat) the update on the feed is not shown on L2's and [OracleLib](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-foundry-defi-stablecoin/blob/main/src/libraries/OracleLib.sol#) continues to work for the next 2-3 hours, until `secondsSince > TIMEOUT` [becomes true](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-foundry-defi-stablecoin/blob/main/src/libraries/OracleLib.sol#L30).

## Impact
Prices could be perceived as fresh even tho they are not.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendations
Use a chainlink [oracle](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-use-chainlink-price-feeds-on-arbitrum/#almost_done!_meet_the_l2_sequencer_health_flag) to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
