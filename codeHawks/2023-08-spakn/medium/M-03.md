# One of the winner can be a blacklisted address

## Summary
One of the winner can select a for a blacklisted address to receive the funds. This will block the whole transaction and revert it.

## Vulnerability Details
Due to users not being registered within the contract and the owner inputting addresses, a potential issue arises. If any user submits a blacklisted USDC address to receive funds, the entire transaction would fail. Consequently, this would obstruct other users from receiving their designated funds. On top of that this user cannot be excluded from the rewards, as the given BPS must match 100%.
```jsx
        if (totalPercentage != (10000 - COMMISSION_FEE)) {
            revert Distributor__MismatchedPercentages();
        }
```

## Impact
User loss of funds.

## Recommendations
Use pull instead of push. Make the users claim their rewards.
