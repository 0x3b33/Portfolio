# Owner can choose himself as the winner

## Summary
The vulnerability arises from the competition's current structure, where the owner holds the authority to select winners. This setup opens the possibility for the owner to exploit the situation by designating themselves as the sole recipient.

## Vulnerability Details
- The competition's tasks are executed on a web2.
- The owner manually chooses the competition winners.
- Monetary rewards are disbursed upon task completion.

From these three premises, it becomes evident that the owner's distribution of funds appears altruistic. Upon competition finalization, the owner attains their desired outcome without the obligation to allocate funds externally. This scenario sets the stage for a cost-saving exploit: **the owner can opt to declare themselves as the exclusive winner**. This can be even masked to look natural, by the owner having multiple secondary addresses and choosing them as the winners in the competition.

## Impact
User loss of funds.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendations
For this issue recommendations are hard to give, since this is about the structure of the whole project.
