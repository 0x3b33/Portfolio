### Any borrower can avid liquidation by doing a `refinance` with small amounts of tokens

## Summary
Any borrower that has a loan due to be seized can call refinance with small amount and move his loan to a different pool, stopping the liquidation/seizing.

## Vulnerability Details
When an auction is started on any loan it's [start time](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L448) is set and from this moment on-wards the pool owner who started the auction can call [seizeLoan](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L548-L586) to seize the loan and claim it's collateral. However any borrower can set up a fron-runner bot and when he sees that his loan is gonna be seized he can call [refinance](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L591-L710) with small amount of collateral/loan tokens and move his loan to another pool, and because with `refinance` the loan auction start time [is reset](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L692) it's pending call to [seizeLoan](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L548-L586) will also fail.
```jsx
            loans[loanId].auctionStartTimestamp = type(uint256).max;
```
This is all possible mainly because under `refinance` the borrower is not expected to pay any part for his loan, as long as he [matches](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L618) the next pool **loan to collateral ratio** he is free to move.
```jsx
uint256 loanRatio = (debt * 10 ** 18) / collateral;
```

## Impact
Borrower can DoS [seizeLoan](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L548-L586) making his function not sizable.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendations
Place a if statement that prohibits a borrower to call `refinance`.
```jsx
if(loans[loanId].auctionStartTimestamp != type(uint256).max) revert BorrowerUnderLiquidation();
``` 
Or make him pay some part of the loan in order to be eligible to refinance.
