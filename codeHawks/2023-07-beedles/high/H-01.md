### `refinance` reduces the pool's balance by the debt twice

## Summary
[refinance](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L591-L710) accidentally reduces the new pool balance **2** times instead of one, charging it 2x the debt balance.

## Vulnerability Details
`refinance` as the name suggest refinances a loan, this means it can change a few of it's parameters, like reducing or increasing debt or changing the pool it uses and so on. 

The current issue  with this function is that it accidentally reduces the balances of the new pool twice once [here](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L636) and twice [here](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L698). This means that it charges the pool of the lender twice instead of once thus lowering his potential profits, messing up the accounting and lowering the amount he can withdraw from the system.

This can be exploited accidentally when a normal user tries to refinance his loan or maliciously when someone want to cause harm on a given user.

Example: 
This is Alice's pool
| *Preconditions*       | *values*   |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Loan : Debt tokens    | USDC : DAI |
| Max borrow percentage | 60%        |
| Pool balance          | 1000 USDC  |

1.  Bob sees this pool, but he does not like Alice (for some reason), so he makes his own pool with the same parameter.
2.  Then Bob takes a loan of 300 USDC and provides 500 DAI.
3.  Bob calls [refinance](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L591-L710) on his loan to move it from his pool to Alice's one.
4.  Now because of how refinance works Bob's pool is 100% sloven so he can withdraw everything. 


Lets see how the refinance TX went:
Firstly everything is [extracted](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L593-L606) and then [checked](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L608-L619), as expected the checks pass (because Bob created the exact same pool as Alice's one). Afterwards Bob [pays](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L622-L626) small fees for his action and his pool [becomes solvent](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L629-L633) again. Now Alice's pool gets [charged](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L636-L637) the new debt

```jsx
            _updatePoolBalance(poolId, pools[poolId].poolBalance - debt);
            pools[poolId].outstandingLoans += debt;
```
After some [transfers](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L639-L674) to make sure everything is up and right the loan is moved to the new pool where the new pool balances [are reduced](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L698) again.
```jsx
pools[poolId].poolBalance -= debt;
```

5. Now because of the double debt removal, Alice's pool recorded balance (`pools[poolId].poolBalance`) is 400 USDC (600 less), and her collateral is only 500 DAI

## Recommendations
Deduct the debt from the pool balance only once, and remove the [second](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L698C13-L698C38) reduction.
```jsx
            loans[loanId].collateral = collateral;
            loans[loanId].interestRate = pool.interestRate;
            loans[loanId].startTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            loans[loanId].auctionStartTimestamp = type(uint256).max;
            loans[loanId].auctionLength = pool.auctionLength;
            loans[loanId].lender = pool.lender;
-           pools[poolId].poolBalance -= debt; //@audit this is not needed
```
