### Front-runnig the first deposit on stake yealds the whole WETH amount

## Summary
By inserting a transaction between the deployment of [staking](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L88) and depositing of the first amount of  WETH you can steal this whole amount.

## Vulnerability Details
Lets say Beedle has been active for some time and the owners have collected some fees. They decide to deploy staking and but 1 WETH inside of it as the initial deposit. After sending their TX for deployment and before the TX for sending WETH, an attacker can would be able to insert his own TX
in the middle of them to. He would just need to deposit any amount of TNK (it could be as little as 1 wei). adn when the WETH is send he can call [claim](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L53-L58) and claim 100% of it.

Example
1. Owners deploy the contract and afterwards send 1 WETH to it, as staking incentives
2. Attacker sees that so he inserts his [deposit](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L38-L42) TX of 1 wei between these 2 and boost the 3 TX with Flashbots (for he to be sure they will execute in this order) 

Now after the deposit [update](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L61-L76) and [updateFor](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L80-L94). Where on update the index will be 0, since the [2 balances](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L65) will be equal.
```jsx
            uint256 _balance = WETH.balanceOf(address(this));//@audit this is 0
            if (_balance > balance) {// if (0 > ?) => false
``` 
Because index is 0 [updateFor](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L92) will set the attacker index as 0 also.

3. After 1 WETH is send the attacker just calls [claim](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L53-L58) where [update](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L66-L73) will trigger and the global index will become 1e36.

```jsx
            uint256 _balance = WETH.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (_balance > balance) {
                uint256 _diff = _balance - balance;
                if (_diff > 0) {
                    //@audit 1e18 * 1e18 / 1 => 1e36
                    uint256 _ratio = _diff * 1e18 / totalSupply; 
                    if (_ratio > 0) {
                      index = index + _ratio;
                      balance = _balance;
                    }
                }
```
From there on his share [would increase](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L88-L89) to 1e18, and claim will [send it](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L55).

## Impact
Attacker would be able to steal 100% of the initial deposit with amount of TKN as low as 1 wei.

## Recommendations
You can inprove on the math fro calculating and updating the rewards, or after deployment make sure there are a lot of staked users and then send the WETH.
