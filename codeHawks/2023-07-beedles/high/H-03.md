### Any lender can drain the contract

## Summary
Any lender can drain the contract, or at least mess up the accounting with the the help of [seizeLoan](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L548-L586) 

## Vulnerability Details
Due to [seizeLoan](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L548-L586) doing 2 [transfers](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L563-L568), before doing any updates to the loan, it is possible for a malicious lender to reenter and cause some harm to the protocol.

Pools can be made with any token (even malicious one) meaning sooner or later a ERC777 token (or any token that has before/after transfer hook) will be used. Any lender who has a pool with such token as collateral will be able to reenter `seizeLoan` dues to it's code not following "checks-effects-interactions" pattern. 

```jsx
            IERC20(loan.collateralToken).transfer(feeReceiver, govFee);
            // transfer the collateral tokens from the contract to the lender
            IERC20(loan.collateralToken).transfer(
                loan.lender,
                loan.collateral - govFee
            );
            ...
            pools[poolId].outstandingLoans -= loan.debt;
            ...
            delete loans[loanId];
        }
```

From the code snippet above we can see that a transfer is made before any changes on the loan is done. So a malicious lender needs to call this function again with the same parameters and score a double payout, or even call it many times in a row for increased profits.

Example scenario:



| *Preconditions*                 | *values*       |
|---------------------------------|----------------|
| Loan tokenA : tokenB Collateral | ERC20 : ERC777 |
| Pool size                       | 10 000         |
| max LTV                         | 50%            |
| Borrower count                  | 8              |
| tokenA left                     | 2 000          |
| tokenB in                       | 16 000         |
| Borrow amount to be seized      | 1 000          |


Now one of the borrowers is insolvent so the pool owner (must be a contract) [starts an auction](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L437-L459) and afterwards calls [seizeLoan](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L548-L586). Now [this](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L563-L568) transfer will trigger his [tokensReceived](https://github.com/0xjac/ERC777/blob/devel/contracts/ERC777TokensRecipient.sol) function in his smart contract, from where `tokensReceived` will call multiple times `seizeLoan`, gaining 1000 collateral tokens with every call, and because the loan is [modified](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L575-L584) after the transfer he would be able to successfully extract as much collateral tokens from the contract as he wants.

## Impact
Lender would be able to drain the contract

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendations
Save the amounts, then delete/update the loan and then transfer.
