### Due to `sellProfits` being public people can reduce the profits for the system 

## Summary
Due to [sellProfits](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Fees.sol#L26-L44) being public people can wait and call it in bad times to reduce the profits for the system.

## Vulnerability Details
Example scenario is when [Lender](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol) contract generates 5 WETH in profits and current price of WETH 2000$ two thing can occur:
- Attacker waits until the price raises (for example 2100$) and then calls [sellProfits](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Fees.sol#L26-L44).
- Because it is public an attacker, may sandwich this TX with a flash loan trade.

---

To sandwich it with your smart contract (or a bot) you will need to execute a single transaction where:

**1** Take a Flash Loan.

**2** Buy WETH from the uni pool that [Fees](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Fees.sol) use.

**3** Call [sellProfits](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Fees.sol#L26-L44)

**4** Sell all of the WETH that you have bought.

**5** Repay the Flash Loan.

**6** Profit
