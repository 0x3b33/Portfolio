### Any User can drain the contract with the help of `setPool` 

## Summary
Because [setPool](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L130-L176) does a transfer before configuring the pool it is possible for anyone to re-enter and drain the contract.

## Vulnerability Details
From the beetle we can see that Lenders make pool that borrowers borrow from, but all tokens are stored in one shared contract - [Lender](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol). Now if any of the lenders makes a pool with an ERC777 token (or any other token with a hook) other Users will be able to drain this pool and steal all of the tokens. This is all possible because  [setPool](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L130-L176) does [this transfer](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L157-L163) before [setting](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L175) the storage of a given pool.
```jsx
       } else if (p.poolBalance < currentBalance) {
            // if new balance < current balance then transfer the difference back to the lender
            IERC20(p.loanToken).transfer(
                p.lender,
                currentBalance - p.poolBalance
            );
        }
        ... //some events are emitted here
        pools[poolId] = p;
```

How to re-enter:
There are 2 pools **A : B** and **C : D** where one of the two tokens is re-enterable.

| *Preconditions*                                 | *values*       |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Loan tokenA : tokenB Collateral                 | ERC777 : ERC20 |
| Pool size                                       | 10 000         |
| TokenA token left in the pool(ERC777 remaining) | 5000           |
| Loan tokenC : tokenD Collateral                 | ERC20 : ERC777 |
| Pool size                                       | 4000           |
| TokenD token left in the pool(ERC777 remaining) | 3000           |
| **Total ERC777 in contract**                    | **8000**       |

**Steal from A : B**

1. Create a pool A : B with 1000 of tokenA
2. Call [setPool](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L130-L176) on that pool, only changing the loan amount from 1000 to 500
3. [This](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L157-L163) transfer will trigger and transfer 500 tokens to your contract from where you will re-enter 5000 / 500 = 10 times
4. Withdraw your initial 1000 loan tokens 

**Steal from C : D**

1. Make a pool with D as loan token (the re-enter "hack" only steals loan tokens) with again 1000 tokenD
2. Call [setPool](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L130-L176) on that pool, only changing the loan amount from 1000 to 500
3. [This](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L157-L163) transfer will trigger and transfer 500 tokens to your contract from where you will re-enter 3000 / 500 = 6 times
4. Withdraw your initial 1000 loan tokens 

## Impact
Any user can drain every ERC777 token from the contract.

Manual review.

## Recommendations
Either prohibit ERC777 tokens, by having whitelist on allowed tokens, or use [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) by OZ.
