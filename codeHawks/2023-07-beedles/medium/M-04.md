### `buyLoan` can be called on another user's pool, thus messing up their plans 

## Summary
[buyLoan](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L465-L534) can be called by any user, even ones **not owning a pool** to move a random loan to a different pool.

## Vulnerability Details
Although  [comments](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L462C1-L462C1) suggests that this function should only interact with your pool, there is no reinforcement on it. And because of that anyone can DoS any pool owner by simply moving any of the loans to his pool.

Example:

- Pool owner is planing to leave the system, having 4k in loan tokens and last borrower of his spool has just payed 1k (5k in total) 
- Malicious user calls [buyLoan](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L465-L534) on any random loan (that matches collateral and loan tokens) to move it to his pool and eat up his loan tokens.
- Now pool owner is not being able to withdraw his loan tokens and needs to wait until this borrower pays his debt

## Impact
Anyone can mess up the poo owner intentions and Dos them of their loan/collateral tokens.

## Tools Used
Manual review 

## Recommendations
Have an `if()` to prohibit using this function with any pool that is not yours.
```jsx
    function buyLoan(uint256 loanId, bytes32 poolId) public {

        Loan memory loan = loans[loanId];
+       if (msg.sender != loan.lender) revert Unauthorized();
        ...
```
