### Unchecked trasnfer/trasnferFrom may lead to silent returns 

## Summary
Not using the safe version of `transfer` and `transferFrom` may lead to loss of funds, due to silent fails.
## Vulnerability Details
Some tokens comply to the ERC20 interface and others don't. Because of this it's best to always check the return of `transfer` or `trasnferFrom` or even better, to use the [safe](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) version.

Example scenario is  if we use USDT - it returns false on failed transfers, and does not revert. So any  not checked transfer could fail silently and the code in **Bleedle** to continue executing without the funds being sent.
## Impact
Loss of funds for the system and the users.

Manual review
## Recommendations
Use `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` from [SafeERC20.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol)
