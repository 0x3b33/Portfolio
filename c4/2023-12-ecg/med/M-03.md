# Liquidators can extract extra value with flash loans, significantly reducing profits for other users

## Impact

Liquidators will be able to flash loan [mint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/SimplePSM.sol#L103-L112) and [stake](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/SurplusGuildMinter.sol#L114-L155) before liquidating the borrower, extracting maximal potential value. While advantageous for liquidators, this significantly reduces gauge stakers' profits without changing the associated risks.

## Proof of Concept

To extract the maximal possible value, bidders (liquidators) will [mint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/SimplePSM.sol#L103-L112) with PSM and [stake](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/SurplusGuildMinter.sol#L114-L155) in the gauge they are liquidating. This is because, upon liquidation, [onBid](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/LendingTerm.sol#L789-L798) calls **ProfitManager**'s [notifyPnL](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/governance/ProfitManager.sol#L342-L405), distributing part of the interest to gauge voters. This process is achievable in a single transaction, incentivizing liquidators to do it for every profitable (positive PnL) liquidation.

Example:

| *Prerequisites*                  | *Values*        |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Borrower coll                    | 10,000 USDC     |
| Borrower loan                    | 7,000 USDC      |
| Borrower fees (start + interest) | 1,000 USDC      |
| Gauge weight                     | 10,000          |
| PM split - buffer/credit/gauge   | 20% / 40% / 40% |

1. Borrower misses a payment.
2. [Call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/LendingTerm.sol#L678-L680) triggers the auction, reaching a profitable point of 8,000 USDC credit for 8,100 USDC collateral.
3. Alice executes a Flash loan transaction:
   - Flash loan 90,000 USDC
   - Mint 90,000 gUSDC
   - Stake 90,000 gUSDC into the gauge
   - Bid on Bob's loan.
   - Call SGM [getRewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/SurplusGuildMinter.sol#L216-L290)
   - Unstake 90,000 gUSDC
   - Redeem 90,360 gUSDC
   - Pay the loan

After Alice bids on Bob's loan, [calculations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/LendingTerm.sol#L751-L768) are performed, and **ProfitManager**'s [notifyPnL](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/governance/ProfitManager.sol#L292) is called with 1,000 USDC to split. PM allocates 400 USDC to the gauge. However, Alice holds 90k out of 100k weight (90%), entitling her to 90% of the gauge's profit (360 USDC).

Alice profits 360 USDC from the FL (460 USDC in total) + the gauge tokens that SGM mints as [rewardsRatio](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/SurplusGuildMinter.sol#L252-L261) (360 with `rewardRatio` of 1), while the remaining gauge stakers split the remaining 40 USDC. This scenario disincentivizes staking for a given gauge, as liquidation becomes a safer and more profitable alternative.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implementing a dripping mechanism similar to that used with credit tokens ([here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC20RebaseDistributor.sol#L168)) may be the most effective solution, albeit making gauges more complex. Alternatively, pausing [mint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/SimplePSM.sol#L103-L112) could be considered, but this might only make it more challenging as liquidators can still use flash loans to acquire credits through other means.
