# Deprecating a gauge can cause a massive loss for lenders

## Impact
If market conditions change, some markets might consider deprecating specific gauges. However, this action could trigger a bank run on the gauge, leading to permanent losses for some lenders, as their credit tokens would be slashed if a borrower leaves with bad debt.

## Proof of Concept
When [offBoarding](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/governance/LendingTermOffboarding.sol#L153-L170) a gauge, PSM is paused, preventing the so-called "bank runs." Nevertheless, these bank runs are still likely to occur in the case of the removed gauge, where voters will attempt to exit before any bad debt accrues, otherwise, they face potential slashing. This will be feasible for some but not for all, as voters cannot decrease the gauge weight below its issuance. This limitation is enforced by the **GuildToken**'s [_decrementGaugeWeight](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/tokens/GuildToken.sol#L224-L231), which checks if the issuance of the term is below the [debtCeiling](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/LendingTerm.sol#L270).

```solidity
uint256 issuance = LendingTerm(gauge).issuance();
if (issuance != 0) {
    uint256 debtCeilingAfterDecrement = LendingTerm(gauge).debtCeiling(-int256(weight));
    require(
        issuance <= debtCeilingAfterDecrement,
        "GuildToken: debt ceiling used"
    );
}
```

If there are still existing borrowers (whose auctions haven't finished), lenders are not allowed to leave. If one of these borrowers causes bad debt, all lenders will be slashed. The pausing mechanism that aims to stop these bank runs is not working correctly, as they are still likely to happen. In this scenario, the first lenders will win (avoiding credit slashing), while the last will lose (being slashed).

Example:

1. GaugeA is deprecated and every borrower is [_called](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/loan/LendingTerm.sol#L683-L688).
2. Alice calls [decrementGauge](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC20Gauges.sol#L301-L312) in order to leave the gauge.
3. Bob front-runs Alice and leaves before her.
4. When Alice TX executes [_decrementGaugeWeight](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/tokens/GuildToken.sol#L224-L231) reverts as she is trying to lower the weight bellow the issuance.
5. Eve auction ends and she accrues bad debt for the gauge.
6. Alice gets slashed.

In this example Alice was fast enough to leave, but due to the [issuance check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/tokens/GuildToken.sol#L224-L231) she still gets slashed. 

## Tools Used
Manual review.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
One option is to keep PSM paused and skip [this if](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/main/src/tokens/GuildToken.sol#L224-L231), if a gauge is removed. This approach will halt the bank run from the gauge and still use the `creditMultiplier` as a tool for splitting bad debt.

```diff
+  if (isGauge(gauge)) { // This will stop deprecated gauges from entering
     uint256 issuance = LendingTerm(gauge).issuance();
     if (issuance != 0) {
          uint256 debtCeilingAfterDecrement = LendingTerm(gauge).debtCeiling(-int256(weight));
          require(
             issuance <= debtCeilingAfterDecrement,
             "GuildToken: debt ceiling used"
          );
     }
+  }
```
