# Bidder can acidentally bid after the auction has ended, leaving his bid stuck in the contract

## Impact
[claimAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L104-L120) and [participateToAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L58) both use `<=`, which can result in bidders accidentally bidding immediately after the auction ends. This can lead to their bids becoming stuck in the contract.

```solidity
function participateToAuction(...) public {...
require(block.timestamp <= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid)...);

function claimAuction(...) public WinnerOrAdminRequired(_tokenid,this.claimAuction.selector){
require(block.timestamp >= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid)...);
```

## Proof of Concept
Shortly after the winner of an auction ends it by calling [claimAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L104-L120), a bidder's transaction can execute and bid for the just-ended auction. This is possible because bidders can bid at the exact closing time, which should not be possible.

```solidity
function participateToAuction(uint256 _tokenid) public payable {
    require(.. && block.timestamp <= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid) && ...);
```

Example scenario:
1. Bob sends a bid a few seconds before the closing time.
2. The bid transaction remains in the mempool.
3. The winner closes the auction.
4. Right after [claimAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L104-L120), Bob's [participateToAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L57-L61) gets executed.

The winner (which should have been the last bidder - Bob, but it's the guy before him) receives his NFT, and all of the users get refunded on their bids, except for Bob. His bid remains stuck in the contract.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Change from `<=` to `<` in [participateToAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L57-L61) to make it impossible for bidders to bid after an auction has ended.

```diff
function participateToAuction(uint256 _tokenid) public payable {
-   require(msg.value > returnHighestBid(_tokenid) && block.timestamp <= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid) && minter.getAuctionStatus(_tokenid) == true);
+   require(msg.value > returnHighestBid(_tokenid) && block.timestamp < minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid) && minter.getAuctionStatus(_tokenid) == true);
    auctionInfoStru memory newBid = auctionInfoStru(msg.sender, msg.value, true);
    auctionInfoData[_tokenid].push(newBid);
}
```
