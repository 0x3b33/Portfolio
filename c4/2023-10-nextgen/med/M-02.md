# getPrice `salesOption` 2 can round down to the lower barrier, skipping the last time period

## Impact
[getPrice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L530) in `salesOption` 2 can round down to the lower barrier, effectively skipping the last time period. In simpler terms, if the price is scheduled to decrease over 4 hours, it will decrease for 2.999... hours and then jump to the price at the end of the 4th hour.

## Proof of Concept
[getPrice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L530) uses [this else-if calculation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L553) to determine whether it should return the price as an equation or just the final price.

```solidity
if (((collectionMintCost - collectionEndMintCost) / rate) > tDiff) {
    price = collectionPhases[_collectionId].collectionMintCost - (tDiff * collectionPhases[_collectionId].rate);
} else {
    price = collectionPhases[_collectionId].collectionEndMintCost;
}
```

The if statement's method of division by `rate` is incorrect, as it results in rounding down and incorrect price movements. This can cause the price to jump over the last time period, effectively decreasing faster than intended.

Example:

| Values                  |                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `collectionMintCost`    | 0.49 ETH          |
| `collectionEndMintCost` | 0.1 ETH           |
| `rate`                  | 0.1 ETH (per hour)|
| `timePeriod`            | 1 hour - 3600 sec |

Hour 0 to 1 - 0.49 ETH
Hour 1 to 2 - 0.39 ETH - as it crosses the 1st hour, the price becomes 0.39 ETH
Hour 2 to 3 - 0.29 ETH - same here
It should go from 3 to 4 to 0.19 ETH, but that step is missed, and it goes directly to 0.1 ETH - the final price.
Hour 3 to 4 - 0.10 ETH - the final price

## Math
The equation for calculating `tDiff` using the provided variables is:

$$
tDiff = \frac{{\text{block.timestamp} - \text{collectionPhases}[\text{collectionId}].\text{allowlistStartTime}}}{{\text{collectionPhases}[\text{collectionId}].\text{timePeriod}}}
$$



We want the crossover when hour 2 switches to 3, which is when `(block.timestamp - collectionPhases[_collectionId].allowlistStartTime)` = 3 h or 10800 sec.

$$
tDiff = \frac{10800}{3600} = 3
$$

We plug in `tDiff` and the other variables into the [if](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L553).

```solidity
if (((collectionPhases[_collectionId].collectionMintCost - collectionPhases[_collectionId].collectionEndMintCost) 
                / (collectionPhases[_collectionId].rate)) > tDiff) {
```

$$
\frac{0.49 \times 10^{18} - 0.1 \times 10^{18}}{0.1 \times 10^{18}} = \frac{0.39 \times 10^{18}}{0.1 \times 10^{18}} = 3
$$

We obtain 3 as the answer, which is due to rounding down, as we divide 0.39 by 0.1. Solidity only works with whole numbers, causing the [if](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L553) to fail as `3 > 3` is false. This leads to entering the else statement where the last price of 0.1 ETH is returned, effectively missing one step of the 4-hour decrease.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
A simple yet effective suggestion is to add `=` in the [if](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L553).

```diff
-  if (...) > tDiff){ 
+  if (...) >= tDiff){ 
```
