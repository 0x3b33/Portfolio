# Users can re-enter with mint in order to mint as many NFTs as they want 

## Impact
Whitelisted users can mint before the public mint starts, but they are restricted in the number of NFTs they can mint. However, they will be able to re-enter the [mint]() function and mint as many NFTs as they want.

## Proof of Concept
When the mint function is called, users need to verify their order with the Merkle tree by inputting their correct `_maxAllowance` and `tokData`. After they are verified, [gencore.mint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L236) is called to mint their tokens. However, before increasing `tokensMintedAllowlistAddress`, [_mintProcessing](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L193-L196) is called.

```solidity
            _mintProcessing(mintIndex, _mintTo, _tokenData, _collectionID, _saltfun_o);
            if (phase == 1) {
                tokensMintedAllowlistAddress[_collectionID][_mintingAddress] += 1;
            }
```
This, in turn, mints the user their NFT.

```solidity
    function _mintProcessing(...) internal {
        tokenData[_mintIndex] = _tokenData;
        collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID].randomizer.calculateTokenHash(_collectionID, _mintIndex, _saltfun_o);
        tokenIdsToCollectionIds[_mintIndex] = _collectionID;
        _safeMint(_recipient, _mintIndex);
    }
```
Because it uses `safeMint`, users are called by the 721 Contract with [_checkOnERC721Received](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L312-L315). This call can be caught in the attacker's contract, and from there, reentrancy begins. After the mint is done, the attacker can call `MinterContract.mint` again, and the requirement that checks their max mint limit will pass. 

```solidity
    } else {
         node = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _maxAllowance, tokData));
         //@audit if we re-enter `retrieveTokensMintedALPerAddress` will return the not yet updated value
         require(_maxAllowance >= gencore.retrieveTokensMintedALPerAddress(col, msg.sender) + _numberOfTokens, "AL limit");
         mintingAddress = msg.sender;
    }
```
This is because we re-entered before `tokensMintedAllowlistAddress` had the chance to increase, which means that [gencore.retrieveTokensMintedALPerAddress](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L217) still has the old value.

Due to this reentrancy, whitelisted users can mint more NFTs than they should. This will also have an effect on phase 3 sales, enabling users to mint NFTs before [the price has had a chance to update](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L240-L254). Overall, this breaks the concept of users being restricted in the number of NFTs they can mint.

## Tools Used
Manual review.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add [nonReentrant](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L55-L59) in the minting functions.
