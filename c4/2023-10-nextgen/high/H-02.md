# Winner and bidders can double refunds their bids

## Impact
Due to [claimAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L104-L120) and [cancelBid](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L124-L130) both using `=` in their time equations, bidders will be able to double refunds their bids.
 
```solidity
function claimAuction(...) public WinnerOrAdminRequired(_tokenid,this.claimAuction.selector){
require(block.timestamp >= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid)...);

function cancelBid(...) public {...
require(block.timestamp <= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid)...);
```


## Proof of Concept
The winner is able to [claim the auction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L105) at it's **exact auction end time**.
```solidity
function claimAuction(...) public WinnerOrAdminRequired(_tokenid,this.claimAuction.selector){
require(block.timestamp >= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid)...);
```
However bidders are also able [to cancel their bids](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L125) at **exact auction end time**.
```solidity
function cancelBid(...) public {...
require(block.timestamp <= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid)...);
```

This means that the winner can claim, and him or some bidder to double refunds their bids. This is done by first using the refund in [claimAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L115-L117) and then canceling his bid with [cancelBid](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L124-L130).

A few example scenarios occur, where in order to do this you must have some failed (not winning) bids:

1. The winner can make multiple bids and either re-enter [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L116) after every not winning bid and refund it, or simply schedule in one TX [claimAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L104-L120) and [cancelBid](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L124-L130) on all his not winning bids.

2. Users can re-enter their failed bids and refunds them.

3. Seller of the NFT can re-enter and claim his failed bids.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Even if the re-entracy is fixed the winner would still be able to schedule [claimAuction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L104-L120) and [cancelBid](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L124-L130) in one TX and double refund his other bids. The main issue is `<=` which needs to be made `<` in [cancelBid](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L124-L130).
