## Impact
Rewards could be stolen on users who have withdrawn most of their LP from the UNIv2 ETH/LBR pool, but not replayed their borrow.

## Proof of Concept
Because [`EUSDMiningIncentives`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/miner/EUSDMiningIncentives.sol) has a function to purchase rewards of users with small amount of LP it is possible to do the same for users with large amounts too, if they are not caucus with their funds. The exploit trigers when users with many rewards first unstake the LP and then repay the borrow amount. Between the 2 transaction MEV could be squished to extract his rewards. This exploit is possible dues to how [`isOtherEarningsClaimable`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/miner/EUSDMiningIncentives.sol#L188-L190) works
```jsx
//if all of the LP is withdrawn the calculation comes to "0 / borrow_amount < 500" => true
    function isOtherEarningsClaimable(address user) public view returns (bool) {
// (user_LP_in_pools * 10 000) / borrow_amount_from_vaults < 500
        return (stakedLBRLpValue(user) * 10000) / stakedOf(user) < 500;
    }
```
[`stakedLBRLpValue`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/miner/EUSDMiningIncentives.sol#L149-L157) is the value staked in the UNIv2 ETH/LBR, represented in `ethlbrLpToken`
[`stakedOf`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/miner/EUSDMiningIncentives.sol#L136-L147) is the borrow amount from any of the vaults ([RETH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraRETHVault.sol) /  [stETH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraWstETHVault.sol) ...)
Example:
- UserA has 1000e18 `ethlbrLpToken`, combined dept of 200e18 and some unclaimed rewards of 100e18 EUSD
- UserA unstakes his LP from the UNI ETH/LBR pool and sends another transaction to claim his rewards and repay
- UserB sees the second transaction and quickly front-runs userA with `purchaseOtherEarnings`, where `isOtherEarningsClaimable` is triggered

```jsx
    function isOtherEarningsClaimable(address user) public view returns (bool) {
        // (0 * 10000) / 200e18 = 0 ===> 0 < 500 -true
        return (stakedLBRLpValue(user) * 10000) / stakedOf(user) < 500;
    }
```
- UserB pays only 1/3 of the fees generated by UserA due to this [calculation]() and claims all of the rewards

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
You can remove or refactor this function, but dues to it's complexity I am not sure how it should be refactored.
