## Impact
Due to the use of wrong function in `getAssetPrice` -> `getExchangeRatio` (which does not exist) the `LybraRETHVault.getAssetPrice` will revert, causing the whole contract to malfunction.

## Proof of Concept
In [LybraRETHVault](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraRETHVault.sol) when users deposit eth and try to mint PeUSD, they call[ depositEtherToMint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraRETHVault.sol#L27-L39). This function calculates their deposit amount and if they want to mint PeUSD it calls [_mintPeUSD](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraRETHVault.sol#L35) with  amount and price. 

Now the issue occurs when we call [`getAssetPrice`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraRETHVault.sol#L46-L48) This function gets the ether price, RETH to ETH conversion ration and calculated the RETH price in USD. This implementation is faulty tho, because RETH does not have function  called [getExchangeRatio](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraRETHVault.sol#L47), they have [getExchangeRate](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/api/js/RETH.html#getexchangerate). This means that  `getAssetPrice` will **call the fallback on RETH**, if they have it, **or revert all together**.
```jsx
    function getAssetPrice() public override returns (uint256) {
     //@audit RETH does not have getExchangeRatio, they have getExchangeRate
         return (_etherPrice() * IRETH(address(collateralAsset)).getExchangeRatio()) / 1e18;
    }
 ```
 One of the developers confirmed in discord that this is a misspelling of the original function, when asked about it. [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/CNBKcck)

> "The correct interface is getExchangeRate(). This was a mistake."

Same interface issue occurs also in [LybraWbETHVault](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraWbETHVault.sol#L10), where again **IWBETH** uses [exchangeRatio](), but the WBET contract has [exchangeRate](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa2E3356610840701BDf5611a53974510Ae27E2e1#readProxyContract). Also making `LybraWbETHVault` not usable, since [getAssetPrice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraWbETHVault.sol#L34-L36) will revert again on calling.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Change the [interface](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraRETHVault.sol#L9-L11):
```jsx
interface IRETH {
    function getExchangeRate() external view returns (uint256);
}
```
And [getAssetPrice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-lybra/blob/main/contracts/lybra/pools/LybraRETHVault.sol#L46-L48):
```jsx
    function getAssetPrice() public override returns (uint256) {
        return (_etherPrice() * IRETH(address(collateralAsset)).getExchangeRate()) / 1e18;
    }
```
