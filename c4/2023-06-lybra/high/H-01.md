## Impact
All the functions in LybraConfigurator.sol can be called by malicious accounts. This breaks the whole protocol, as anyone can change the tokens, the fees and the ratios, the borrow apy or mint unlimited amount of tokens, etc..

## Proof of concept
A malicious user calls a **LybraConfigurator** function that is supposed to be executable only by the **DAO** or the **TIMELOCK** . The following modifiers should check if the caller has the needed rights. Both `GovernanceTimelock.checkOnlyRole()`  and `GovernanceTimelock.checkRole() return booleans indicating if a user has the needed role. However, the returned value is not checked, allowing anyone to execute the certain function.

```jsx
 modifier onlyRole(bytes32 role) {
        GovernanceTimelock.checkOnlyRole(role, msg.sender);
        _;
}

    modifier checkRole(bytes32 role) {
        GovernanceTimelock.checkRole(role, msg.sender);
        _;
    }
```
## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
In both the modifiers, add a require statement that checks the return value of the GovernanceTimelock function. 
```jsx
modifier onlyRole(bytes32 role) {
        require(GovernanceTimelock.checkOnlyRole(role, msg.sender), "NO_ROLE");
        _;
}


modifier checkRole(bytes32 role) {
    require(GovernanceTimelock.checkRole(role, msg.sender), "NO_ROLE");
    _;
}
```
