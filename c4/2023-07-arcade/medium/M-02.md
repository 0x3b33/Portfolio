### `setMultiplier` does not sync the voting power, and voters can abuse it by not refreshing their voting power before a vote

## Impact
[setMultiplier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L363-L371) as the name suggests set a new multiplier for a token address of a given token ID, but it does not sync the voting power afterwards. This can be exploited by voters who after the update have received lower boost (and thus lower voting power), by them not updating their voting power.

## Proof of Concept
[setMultiplier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L363-L371) is a function used by the manager of **NFTBoostVault** to set a new voting power for a NFT and it's corresponding token ID. However after this change no measure is done to enforce it, and voters and delegates are left with the old (before `setMultiplier` was called) voting power. This means if an owner deliberately want to lower to voting power of a certain NFT he can set the boost ration of that NFT to a lower amount, but users with that NFT will still receive the prev. boost, unless they are synced manually.

Example:
1. A given faction has 100 000 tokens and NFTs of type **cow** that gives 150% voting power => 150 000 vote tokens 
2. Owner doesn't like cows (for some reason) so he lowers the voting power of NFT **cow** to 120%
3. The group of user does not care and can vote with the prev. voting power, since the onwer needs to sync their voting power manually, user by user, and thy may cost a fortune

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a modifier that before every call updates the voting power of the `msg.sender`
