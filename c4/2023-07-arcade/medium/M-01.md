### User who have claimed before the update on the merkle tree will have no shares of the rewards afterwards

## Impact
User who have claimed before an update on the merkle tree in [ArcadeAirdrop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeAirdrop.sol) are not gonna be able to claim the extra rewards. The reward tokens will be left stuck in the contract, waiting for the manager to reclaim them.

## Proof of Concept
Due to the nature of how [ArcadeAirdrop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeAirdrop.sol) is made and [the expectation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeAirdrop.sol#L17-L19) that there might be a change in the merkle tree in the near future, users will expect to be able to claim the extra re
wards (if they are increase on merkle root change). However, because there is a problematic [if stamen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol#L106-L107) (that is inherited in [ArcadeAirdrop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeAirdrop.sol) by [ArcadeMerkleRewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol)) users that have already claimed their rewards will have no share of the future ones.

Example: 
1. Alice and Bob bolt have **100** tokens set to be claimed on the Merkle tree
2. Alice claims her **100** tokens
3. The owner sees that there is a huge activity on the platform and wants to incentivize users, so he increases rewards (by changing the merkle root) to **120** tokens
4. Bob claims his **120** tokens
5. Alice sees that and tries to claim the remainder of her **120** tokens (**20**), but the claim reverts because of this [if](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol#L106-L107)

```jsx
    function _validateWithdraw(uint256 totalGrant, bytes32[] memory merkleProof) internal {
        ...
        //@audit if the user has already claimed, he is not able to claim ever again
        if (claimed[msg.sender] != 0) revert AA_AlreadyClaimed();
        claimed[msg.sender] = totalGrant;
    }
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Change the claim implementation the way how [mint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L98-L120) in **ReputationBadge** is done. They have the [total amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L110C47-L110C61) in the merkle tree and track [claimed amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L116C1-L116C1) in a mapping.
