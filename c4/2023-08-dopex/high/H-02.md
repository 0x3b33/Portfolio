# **PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP** `subtractLoss` can  be DoS by donation attack

## Impact
[subtractLoss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.sol#L199-L205) `require` statement makes it possible to DoS this function and makes **PerpetualAtlanticVault** [settle](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVault.sol#L315-L369) unusable. 

## Proof of Concept
The `require` statement in [subtractLoss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.sol#L199-L205) allows an attacker to exploit it by donating a small amount the collateral token, causing the `require` condition to fail consistently.

```jsx
    require(
      collateral.balanceOf(address(this)) == _totalCollateral - loss,
      "Not enough collateral was sent out"
    );
```

The issue arises because this statement strictly checks if the collateral held by the contract ( as balance ) matches the storage variable [_totalCollateral](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.sol#L58). By donating any amount of the collateral token to the contract, the value of `_totalCollateral` remains unchanged, while `collateral.balanceOf(address(this))` changes.

As this function is used in [settle](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVault.sol#L315-L369) process, it can cause repeated reverting, leading to a DoS scenario and preventing the admin from settling any bond.

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
You can modify the [require](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.sol#L200-L203) statement from `==` to `>=`, or use an another check method.

```jsx
    require(
-     collateral.balanceOf(address(this)) == _totalCollateral - loss,
+     collateral.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _totalCollateral - loss,
      "Not enough collateral was sent out"
    );
```
