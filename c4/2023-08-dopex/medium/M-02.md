# `addLiquidity` under **ReLPContract**  lacks a  slippage check, which leads to losses

## Impact
[addLiquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L286-L295) has a slippage input that in neglected in the current code, which combined with the non-existent deadline leads to losses and unpredictable trades.

## Proof of Concept
[addLiquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L286-L295) has 2 parameters (`amountAMin` and `amountBMin`), that account for slippage losses, if the trade executes at a bad time, or protect against MEV. However in the current implementation, the slippage check in not accounted for and in it's place 0 [is used](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L291-L292), meaning any change in price will satisfy the call. This combined with [no deadline](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L294C27-L294C27) (as `block.timestamp` means the TX will pass anytime, 1h, 1 day or even 1 week after is sent) means that the trade can execute at unprecedented time, and unknown prices.

A likely scenario would be for the call to remain stuck in the mem-pool for some days, executing at bad prices - **Protocol receives less LP**
 

```jsx
    (, , uint256 lp) = IUniswapV2Router(addresses.ammRouter).addLiquidity(
      addresses.tokenA,
      addresses.tokenB,
      tokenAAmountOut,
      amountB / 2,
      0,
      0,//@audit should should be `amountBMin`
      address(this),
      block.timestamp + 10//@audit why?
    )
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
You can either add `minA` and `minB `to the function parameters, or like in other contract implement slippage tolerance calculation. Here is my pseudo-code that you can add [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L285), before the [addLiquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L286-L295) call:
```jsx
uint minA = tokenAAmountOut - (tokenAAmountOut * slippageTolerance);
uint minB = amountB / 2 - ((amountB / 2) * slippageTolerance);
```
