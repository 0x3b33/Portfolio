# `reLP` under **ReLPContract** does not return excess, which may lead to small amounts being left stuck in the contract

## Impact
The `reLP` function within the **ReLPContract** does not return excess amounts, potentially resulting in small amounts of WETH being left trapped within the contract.

## Proof of Concept
The [`reLP`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L202-L307) function includes an [`addliquidity`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L286) call to UniSwap v2. Subsequently, the function [returns](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol#L302-L305) the remaining tokenA (RDPX) to the **RdpxV2Core**. However, it neglects to return the remaining tokenB (WETH) held within the contract. Over time, although the un-returned WETH accumulates, but remains permanently trapped within the contract.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
A simple solution would be to modify the code to also return the unused WETH by adding the following changes:

```diff
     IERC20WithBurn(addresses.tokenA).safeTransfer(
       addresses.rdpxV2Core,
       IERC20WithBurn(addresses.tokenA).balanceOf(address(this))
     );
+    IERC20WithBurn(addresses.tokenB).safeTransfer(
+      addresses.rdpxV2Core,
+      IERC20WithBurn(addresses.tokenB).balanceOf(address(this))
+    );
```
